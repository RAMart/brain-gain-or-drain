# brain-gain-or-drain
Simple game used on the "Game development with Clojure" talk at
[FrOSCon](https://www.froscon.de) 2015 

A little brain flys through a galaxy, joyfully eating
[Clojure](http://clojure.org) logos to gain more knowledge.

It's a 2-D side-scroller with two additional parallax layers.

## But... why?
This source was used to demonstrate
- the programming-a-game-while-playing-it-is-awesome effect
- how an why immutable data is a bless
- function composition
- expressiveness

## Where to go from here
- Add brain draining elements to the game
- Add evolution to the game
  - Player starts with the ability to move upwards only
  - Gain knowledge to be able to move up and down
  - Gain more knowledge to move also left and right
  - Gain even more knowledge to alter speed or use transport beams or travel through time
- Create a multi-platform-with-immutable-data-only gaming library
- Have fun
